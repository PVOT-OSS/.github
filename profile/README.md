# PVOT OSS

**PVOT OSS** is an open-source Android platform initiative focused on building a modern AOSP-based ecosystem respecting privacy with first-party system applications and a shared design system.

We maintain an AOSP fork alongside a growing collection of system apps, libraries, and platform components designed to work seamlessly together.
