# PVOT OSS

**PVOT OSS** is an open-source Android platform initiative focused on building a modern AOSP-based ecosystem with first-party system applications and a shared design system.

We maintain an AOSP fork alongside a growing collection of system apps, libraries, and platform components designed to work seamlessly together.

---

## 🧭 Vision

Our goal is to create a **polished, opinionated Android experience** that prioritizes:

- Clean system UI & UX  
- Consistent design across core apps  
- Maintainable, well-structured platform code  
- Open collaboration and transparency  

PVOT is not just a ROM — it’s a **platform**.

## Core Projects

### Platform

- **AOSP Fork**  
  A customized Android Open Source Project base, serving as the foundation for PVOT.

---

### System Applications

PVOT develops and maintains its own first-party system apps to ensure consistency and deep platform integration:

- **Messages**
- **Clock**
- **Calendar**
- **Dialer**
- **Contacts**
- **Calculator**
- **PvotWeather** – A custom weather application built for PVOT

Each app is designed to feel native, minimal, and aligned with the overall PVOT experience.

### 🎨 Design System

- **PvotLib**  
  Our shared design system and UI component library.  
  PvotLib defines typography, color, motion, and reusable components used across all PVOT apps.

> One design language. One ecosystem.
